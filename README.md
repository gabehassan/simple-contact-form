1. grab all the api keys from sendgrid https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/account-and-settings/api-keys/#creating-an-api-key

2. put them in .env file (example: SENDGRID_API_KEY=apikeyhere)

3. set everything correctly in the env file except SENDGRID_DOMAIN as it isnt used yet.
(i commented it out dw)

4. run npm install 

5. run npm start


congratulations! 

the ip field will be broken but you can fix that by exposing it using ngrok

ik this is bad sorry :(
